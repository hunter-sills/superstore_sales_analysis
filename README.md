# Superstore Sales and Profit Analysis

This interactive dashboard and data story, created as part of the Tableau Desktop for Data Analysis course by Maven Analytics, offers key insights into sales and profitability trends within the Superstore dataset. The project demonstrates my ability to apply fundamental skills in data preparation, exploratory data analysis, and dashboard design to translate raw data into actionable business intelligence.

## Problem/Objective
The objective of this project was to build a tool that helps business management answer critical questions about sales and profitability. Using a provided version of the Superstore dataset, the dashboard allows for analysis by geography, product categories, and time periods.
